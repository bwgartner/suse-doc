=== Taksi (Assess/Evaluate) / Tendenco (Trend)

Simple process: (and video links)

* GitHub (source code)
** git clone https://github.com/bwgartner/taksi
** cd taksi
** review the configuration file (taksi.conf) and adjust as needed
*** to change output/transfer locations
** execute sudo ./bin/taksi and review cited outputs in the archive directory

* Package Repository - https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:bwgartner/taksi
** install package (via zypper)
** review the configuration file (taksi.conf) and adjust as needed
*** to change output/transfer locations
** for a manual run, execute sudo /usr/sbin/taksi and review the cited outputs in the archive directory

In essence, this tool looks for recent data bundles, that have arrived since the last run, and (if enabled)

* temporarily unpacks the data bundle
* summarized the hints/clues
* invokes sca-L0 analytics to assess current situation (and capture output) (like mentioned in data pond section)
* (coming soon) looks for previous runs to do trend analysis of time-based changes
