<title>Facility</title>
<simpara>While beyond the scope of this document, the heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) requirements of hosting such an infrastructure solution should be carefully considered and planned. To aid in determining the power requirements for system deployment, use the <ulink url="https://h20195.www2.hpe.com/v2/GetPDF.aspx/4AA6-2925ENW.pdf">HPE Power Advisor</ulink> (available online or as a downloadable application). Using this tool, you can plan the needs for your solution and order the correct Power Distribution Unit (PDU) to account for the local power conditions and connections in the final installation location.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_network">
<title>Network</title>
<simpara>Networking components and their associated services typically require the most advanced planning. Connectivity, capacity and bandwidth requirements for a software-defined storage infrastructure have a fair amount of complexity, especially within the context of an existing IT infrastructure.</simpara>
<simpara>With the range of available network interface card options for HPE ProLiant, the baseline network bandwidth can be easily provided for each resource node and collectively within the software-defined storage deployment. For improved resiliency and performance, it is also possible to bond multiple network interfaces together. While beyond the scope of this document, the only remaining consideration is for capacity and bandwidth for the interconnecting top-of-rack switches.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Given the available options for HPE ProLiant with 10, 25, or 100 GbE speeds, you are encouraged to utilize the higher speed ones to help address the access of many clients and to deal with the back-end replication and recovery aspects, especially as the usage and scale increases.</simpara></note>

<title>Software</title>
<simpara>SUSE Enterprise Storage is an intelligent software-defined storage solution, powered by Ceph technology, that enables you to transform your enterprise storage infrastructure. While a software-defined approach may seem new, the logic within enterprise storage devices has always been written in software. It’s only been in the last few years that hardware has progressed enough so that enterprise storage software and dedicated hardware can now be separated. This provides IT organizations with a a simple-to-manage, agile infrastructure approach&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;yielding increased speed of delivery, durability and reliability. This helps to accelerate innovation, reduce costs and alleviate proprietary hardware lock-in by transforming your enterprise storage infrastructure with a truly open and unified, intelligent software-defined storage solution.</simpara>
<simpara>Our single, truly unified, software-defined storage cluster provides applications with object, block and file system storage.

<simpara>As noted above Ceph supports both native and traditional client access. The native clients are aware of the storage topology and communicate directly with the storage daemons, resulting in horizontally scaling performance. Non-native protocols, such as ISCSI, S3, and NFS require the use of gateways. While these gateways may be thought of as a limiting factor, the ISCSI and S3 gateways can scale horizontally using load balancing techniques.</simpara>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Cluster Networking
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The network environment where you intend to run Ceph should ideally be a bonded set of at least two network interfaces that is logically split into a public part and a trusted internal part, using VLANs. The bonding mode is recommended to be 802.3ad if possible to provide maximum bandwidth and resiliency.  The public VLAN serves to provide the service to the client nodes, while the internal part provides for the authenticated Ceph network communication. The main reason for this is that although Ceph provides authentication and protection against attacks once secret keys are in place, the messages used to configure these keys may be transferred openly and are vulnerable.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Administration Node
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The Admininstration Node is a central point of the Ceph cluster because it manages the rest of the cluster nodes by querying and instructing their Salt minion services. It usually includes other services as well, for example the Ceph Dashboard (formerly known as openATTIC) web interface with the Grafana dashboard backed by the Prometheus monitoring toolkit.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Ceph Monitor
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Ceph Monitor (often abbreviated as MON) nodes maintain information about the cluster health state, a map of all nodes and data distribution rules. If failures or conflicts occur, the Ceph Monitor nodes in the cluster decide by majority which information is correct. To form a qualified majority, it is recommended to have an odd number of Ceph Monitor nodes, starting with at least three of them.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Ceph Manager
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The Ceph manager (MGR) collects the state information from the whole cluster. The Ceph manager daemon runs alongside the monitor daemons. It provides additional monitoring, and interfaces the external monitoring and management systems. The Ceph manager requires no additional configuration, beyond ensuring it is running.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Ceph OSD
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A Ceph OSD is a daemon handling Object Storage Devices which are a physical or logical storage units (hard disks or partitions). Object Storage Devices can be physical disks/partitions or logical volumes. The daemon additionally takes care of data replication and rebalancing, in case of added or removed nodes. Ceph OSD daemons communicate with monitor daemons and provide them with the state of the other OSD daemons.

<simpara>Additionally, this solution can be used for multiple access methods --- object, block, file&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and accessed by clients over many different protocols&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;iSCSI, S3, NFS, SMB. Each of these can be incrementally added over time, using the SUSE Enterprise Storage deployment framework and adding the respective gateway roles and nodes.</simpara>
