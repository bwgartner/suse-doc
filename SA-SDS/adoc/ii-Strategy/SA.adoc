== Strategy

////
The strategy elements are typically used to model the strategic direction and choices of an enterprise, as far as the impact on its architecture is concerned. They can be used to express how the enterprise wants to create value for its stakeholders, the capabilities it needs for that, the resources needed to support these capabilities, and how it plans to configure and use these capabilities and resources to achieve its aims. Strategy elements are used to model the strategic direction and choices of the enterprise, whereas Business Layer elements are used to model the operational organization of an enterprise.

For almost any digital transformation, the strategic directions and choices include estimates to assess the impact on the enterprise and its culture. Taking into account the necessary resources to implement and support the relative, new capabilities is required to avoid potential pitfalls. In an almost iterative way, technology changes can be piloted, with feedback assessed and the adjusted for the next rollout phase.

To address *_Why_* to embark upon a software-defined storage [ {useCase} ] transformation, a core value is the increasing reliance on data-based decisions, compounded by the the ever-increasing, explosive growth of data.

The following figure grapically summarizes these strategic elements:

=== Context

Across all resource layers -- data, information, and intelligence -- the fundamental requirement is quality. Ultimately this can lead to more effective business decisions. Given that most organizations already have one to many storage solutions, the {useCase} transformation includes both assessments and courses of action to reach the next goal or stage.

=== Value Stream

Denoted in the arrow context, the value stream includes the assessment of the current solution followed by selection of the implementation targets. This leads to a course of action with the decisive inputs. As you might guess, this stream can be done in a looping, iterative fashion to address the respective considerations in an effecient, timely and cost effective manner.

=== Capability

A dominant capability concern for enterprise storage is the current and future capacity. Once the usable capacity is measured and determined, additional characteristic factors, listed below, may further impact the raw capacity needed to implement the future storage solution, plus contribute key attributes for the digital transformation decisions:

ifdef::Availability[]
* <<G_Availability,Availability>>
endif::Availability[]
ifdef::Performance[]
* <<G_Performance,Performance>>
endif::Performance[]
ifdef::Security[]
* <<G_Security,Security>>
endif::Security[]
ifdef::Integrity[]
* <<G_Integrity,Integrity>>
endif::Integrity[]

TIP: Basic definitions and explanations for some of the above factors are accessible in the glossary links. Each will also be described in more detail in successive layers.

=== Resources

Initially, one should evaluate a set of current storage resources being utilized and also assess possible future transitions:

Use Case(s)::
It is imperative to collect every relevant use case that relies on the data storage elements under consideration. This needs to include both front-end and back-end software applications plus also the accessibility range from end-users to just machine-centric interfaces.

Locale::
Often dictated by the actual use case and it's proximity requirements, the location of where the data and storage solution resides is paramount. Options of on-premise, multi-site or hybrid-cloud have all become very viable, yet other factors may be the guiding considerations for deployment transformations.

Governance::
In a global and industry vertical sense, data governance footnote:governance[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance[Data governance] is a core consideration. Beyond the previous locality requirements, this includes quality throughout the data's lifecycle. Also, controls, processes, and accountability of the assest that data provides, is necessary within any specific regulations and enterprise policies. 

As part of the strategic planning decision making process, another set of resource attributes is imperative to consider for each possible digital tranformational approach in the {useCase} context:

Total Cost of Ownership::
A very relevant attribute, which is partially a function of the inherent value that data provides over time, is the total cost of ownership to maintain such a storage solution. Given the ever increasing quantity of data, optimizing the total cost of ownership is a high priority. During the digital transformation project(s), it is necessary to also evaluate other attributes to streamline the modernization:
+
* Risk Assessment - especially in the context of an upgrade or migration, considering the resources needed to mitigate possible risks and have viable fallbacks is important
* Scope - as with most projects, iteratively managing the target scope is a method to increase expertise, limit impacts, and successively improve value-add.
* Timeframe - understanding that even simple projects may require longer first attempts, to increase the knowledge base, that may help speed up later, even more complex solution deployments
* Resources - both organizationally internal resources and external partner, supplier or provider should be considered

=== Layered Dependencies

To achieve the desired quality and decision content, the goal is optimized business outcomes as a course of action. With the assessment of currrent states and plans to address the next {useCase} iteration and scope, the underlying business layer model must provide the processes and functions, in the context of the affected stakeholders, to efficiently and completely implement such a transformation project.
