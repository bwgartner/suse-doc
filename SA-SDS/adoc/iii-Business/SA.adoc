////
Business Layer elements are used to model the operational organization of an enterprise in a technology-independent manner, whereas strategy elements are used to model the strategic direction and choices of the enterprise.
////

In the digital transformation of {useCase}, the business layer elements focus on the operational aspects of the organization. This includes:

* *_Who_* are the respective stakeholders,
* *_What_* specific business processes are necessary to address the transition process, along with expectational categories to prioritize
* *_When_* to consider and proceed with each possible iteration of the transformation

These are graphically represented in the following figure:

=== Roles and Collaboration

To be efficient and successful during such a digital transformation, in the context of migrating towards software-defined storage ( {useCase} ), you should engage with the following representative stakeholders:

Executive Board Members::
While the actual directive may be driven from this level, it is also possible for the tranformation to have been cultivated from any of the other layers of stakeholders.  So, keeping these folks engaged and informed is vital to the project to address the impact and the necessary resources being utilized.  Also an individual, like a CIO, may ultimately be held responsible for such changes from such a project, being the focal point for the peers at this level and ensuring that the reasoning behind the project is aligned strategically, that a return on investment will be achieved and the required changes help to answer the needs and overall improve the organization.

Business Line Managers::
Folks in this realm are key to provide what targets should be addressed first and when it makes most sense to do it.  Furthermore, they can use their business perspective to assess possible risk, impact, and measures for successful implementations.  In addition, these individuals are instrumental in formulating a migration plan, aligned with other business constraints and objectives to help target the project's features, quality, cost, schedule and staff. footnote:ProjectDimensions[link:https://medium.com/swlh/rethinking-the-triple-constraint-five-project-dimensions-b3593c364b11[Five Project Dimensions]]

Solution Architects::
These individuals are key resources to understand the existing state of storage usage, to take into account what is currently required to propose replacing existing solutions and potentially what layered features may also be considered going forward.
+
NOTE: These folks, are one of the primary target audiences for this document, adressing all of the layers described from the top down. They can then formulate a set of options to encompass past issues, the current requirements for the next phase and any future, upcoming aspects, by understanding the inherent tradeoffs for each possible path to utilize.

Storage / IT Administrators::
For this digital transformation, initially this set of individuals are potentially most impacted.  Having to deal with such changes of their core infrastructure is potentially overwhelming at first glance, yet learning a few simple alternative approaches often enables them to work more efficiently and leverage the advances that this technology provides.  By engaging these folks, one can get a rather complete picture of the current requirements and predicted usage growth.
+
NOTE: These folks are another target audience, who will likely resonate with the layers of this document from the physical layer and up, using the knowledge of their existing storage solutions within their data centers and how users and applications rely upon them.

Application Developers::
Depending upon the organization structure, application developers may also need to be included in the requirements gathering aspect, to also be made aware of and test the upcoming changes, even if the application APIs they rely upon will not change too much.

IT Administrators::
Engaging with these staff members is critical, since they are ultimately responsible for the service levels of the overall solution, the underlying infrastructure, and the on-going maintenance aspect.  In addition, these folks understand the bits and bytes of the platforms, the actual usage metrics and the existing expertise for these workloads.  Getting them trained on the next iteration of the technologies is inherently important.

So, having representatives of each of these stakeholders engaged up front will help to formulate a more effective plan that can be collective steps forward in the digital transformation.  During the various project phases, more individuals from each of the stakeholder segments may be brought in for awareness, training, testing, and evaluation to ensure continued, iterative success.

IMPORTANT: Depending upon the elements utilized in the following layers, it would also make sense to engage with the respective providers of those components. This could include their technical pre-sales, consulting, services and support teams to more thoroughly plan, configure, deploy and maintain the {useCase} solution.

=== Factors, Flavors and Deployment Scenarios

In both the current state of provisioned storage and possible replacement or augmented {useCase} scenarios, it is imperative to prioritize, address and plan for key factors, the targeted flavors and deployment scenarios.
