The Technology Layer elements are typically used to model the Technology Architecture of the enterprise, describing the structure and behavior of the technology infrastructure of the enterprise.

Providing the necessary structure, behavior and APIs for the applications and direct client access, a software-defined storage solution [ {useCase} ] focuses on delivering the necessary components. A key factor is the policy-based provisioning and management of the provided storage, with an independence and abstraction of the underlying hardware. This is accomplished with artifacts such as software, interfaces, functions, events, paths and flows.

Based on the previous application layers, the following storage interfaces are typically required:

* Object footnote:Object[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage[Object Storage]] - an abstracted combination of unstructured data, a variable amount of descriptive metadata/properties and a globally unique identifier
* Block footnote:Block[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(data_storage)[Block Storage]] - a structured, persistent data store identified by an arbitraryyet assigned identifier for access and retrieval
* Filesystem footnote:Filesystem[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system[Filesystem]] - an allocated storage space, with hierarchial layers for operations, virtual implementations and a physical placement on the storage medium

In addtion, other access protocols are often desired and can be delivered via their respective protocol gateways.
