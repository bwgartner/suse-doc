== Summary
The number of IoT and Edge devices connecting to the Internet is increasing at exponential rates.  Older "Operational Technlogy" platform management methods can no longer keep pace with the innovation and security requirements of these new end-points at scale.  Additionaly, many of these new applications have restrictions on acceptable latency and require compute capabilities closer to where the data is generated.  All of these factors are leading IoT/Edge developers towards container technologies that have been pioneered in more traditional IT environments.

Simplify::
Advantages of managing all IoT/Edge nodes with Kubernetes/Rancher (1000's of nodes) vs. virtualization.   Highlight Rancher's ability to span multi-cloud, virtualized, and on-prem containers (vs. lack of this ability with VMware or HyperCloud based K8s).  Completely open solution stack, no vendor lock-in.

Modernize::
Moving from Operational Technology to IT techniques for scalability.  No longer need to "roll a truck" to update IoT systems.  Most major technologies are moving to containers.  AI/ML, Analytics, etc.  Ability to use these technologies to perform predictive maintenance, improve quality, feed into supply chain systems.  Easier endpoint monitoring.

Accelerate::
No long need to wait for yearly maintenance cycles to upgrade equipment software.  Highlight ability to move to a cloud native CI/CD environment for rapid changes.  Update firmware on endpoints with rollback.   No need to take systems down.  Take advantage of latest versions of technologies (e.g. AI/ML, vision, robotics evolving rapidly)

Containers on the Edge::
Today's IoT environments typically use either bare metal or virtualization for deploying edge workloads.  While each of these approaches has advantages in niche applications, they tend to be less efficient and harder to manage than  containerized workloads.   Bare metal deployments are usually done at the time of manufacture or installation and are updated infrequently due to the usual need to dispatch a technician to manually update the platform.  While relatively straight-forward, this method is not suitable for any device connected to the Internet due to the security risks.  There is no isolation between applications, and the network IP stack is difficult to update with new security patches.
